  "content":"Snacks Yummies reinforces its commitment to the environment and the well-being of Honduran communities. That is why it delivered more than 200 waste collectors to schools in Tegucigalpa, Choluteca, Olancho, Danlí, Comayagua, San Pedro Sula, La Ceiba and Tocoa, in order to promote sustainable practices within educational establishments and further promote environmental responsibility in all children in the country. Each waste collector has the presentation of a Zambos packaging in giant size, a unique and eye-catching design that playfully encourages waste management in the educational environment.This action was carried out in conjunction with strategic partners such as SERMUNAST (Municipal Water and Sanitation Service in Tocoa) and ASIDE (Association for Research and Development), training more than 1,500 children on environmental care, ecosystem protection and proper waste disposal.This action is just the beginning of Snacks Yummies’ ongoing efforts to promote sustainability and environmental conservation in Honduras.",
