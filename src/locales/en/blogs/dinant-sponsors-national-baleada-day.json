  "content": "Dinant, by means of the Mazola, Schilo’s and Zambos brands joined the great catracha party to make National Baleada Day official. Around 50,000 baleadas were given out for free in Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba historic downtowns. In compliance with its Corporate and Social Responsibility policy, Dinant promoted such an interesting activity by donating Mazola lard and oil, and Schilo’s. Additionally, activations with the Zambos brand were carried out, since Zambos are Hondurans’ flagship snack due to their traditional taste. Dinant Executives mentioned that our products are part of Honduran households as they are used on a daily basis to cook every meal. This is why our brand presence was so important in implementing the National Baleada Day. Dinant is a leading Company in the regional market when it comes to snacks, edible oil, food, and household products. Acknowledged for its constant innovation with high-quality products and major commitment to consumers, offering innovation, quality and variety, under the premise of Socially Responsible Company.",
